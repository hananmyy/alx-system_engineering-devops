# Domain: firstvmlab.ddns.net

# Step 1: HAProxy config update (located at /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg)
# --- Added frontend block for HTTP to HTTPS redirection

# Add this to the config file:

# frontend http-in
#     bind *:80
#     redirect scheme https code 301 if !{ ssl_fc }

# Step 2: Restarted HAProxy to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart haproxy

# Step 3: Test HTTP redirection
curl -I http://firstvmlab.ddns.net
# Expected output:
# HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: https://firstvmlab.ddns.net/

# Step 4: Test HTTPS content
curl -s https://firstvmlab.ddns.net
# Expected to return backend content that includes: "ALX"

# Confirmation
# SSL redirection from HTTP to HTTPS works
# Secure content served successfully via HAProxy frontend on port 443
